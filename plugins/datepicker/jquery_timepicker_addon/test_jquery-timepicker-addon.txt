How to use?
***********


You can import ``timepicker`` from ``js.jquery_timepicker_addon`` and ``need``
it where you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.jquery_timepicker_addon import timepicker
  >>> timepicker.need()

Locales
=======

Also included are locales for the timepicker widget.

How to get the right locale for the current request depends on your web framework.
In `Pyramid`_ you could e.g. do something like this::

    from js.jquery_timepicker_addon import timepicker_locales
    from pyramid.i18n import get_locale_name

    locale_name = get_locale_name(request)
    if locale_name in timepicker_locales:
        timepicker_locales[locale_name].need()
